The lesson will introduce different types of MRI modalities and how they can be easily organized and shared. This lesson is also a pre-requisite for the [Structural](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-sMRI), [Functional](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-fMRI) and [Diffusion](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-dMRI) MRI Data Analysis lessons, which go more in-depth into their respective MRI modalities.
